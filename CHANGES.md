# Changes over the parent engine (pf_s25p)

- **v9p (private-safe router)**: v5 plus only the specialist routes that beat nhbot on the hub's VERIFIED (private-seed)
  tier -- Gnomish Archeologists on pf_v36, neutral human Rangers and the female elven Ranger on pf_s25p8, Knights on
  pf_s25p8 -- and no daglar profile for Rangers, Rogues and Tourists (every Ranger and Rogue identity scored lower with
  it); Tourists back on nhbot. The public-seed-selected ports of v6/v7 overfit the 15 public seeds and are left out.
- **v9p2**: v9p plus three routes with one verified sample each: neutral human Archeologists and orcish Barbarians on
  pf_s25p8, neutral human Wizards on pf_vk_s25.

- **v10a**: Healers and Samurai back on nhbot: every Healer and Samurai specialist lost to nhbot on 90 dev held-out
  seeds (hea-gno pf_hg -0.050, hea-hum pf_hh -0.024, sam pf_v35 -0.051).
- **v10b**: dev-confirmed config: Rangers on nhbot without UNSEEN_PET_GUARD (+0.022 +- 0.012, 420 pairs), gnomish
  Cavemen on the Dlvl-1 grind (+0.073 +- 0.022, 120 pairs).
- **v10c**: neutral human Wizards on pf_s25p8 instead of pf_vk_s25 (dev held-out: 0.252 vs 0.153 over 90 seeds; the
  verified tier agrees).
- **eL1fe's fixes** (ported from eL1fe/nethacker@cfc3828, its `dag25` engine = this same base): the spell-direction fix
  (`Agent.cast` sent the compass string as keys: every aimed cast was wasted), force bolt for Wizards (from
  CleverShovel 0d1fb22: never into shops, never flying on into a pet), healing spells for any role that knows them,
  stoning cures, a known teleport scroll as a last resort, no throwing where the pet may stand unseen, Wizards and
  Healers keep off metal body armor/gloves/heavy shields (spell failure), Archeologists dig out of shops, magic
  mapping from Dlvl 3, trees unwalkable, Sokoban/altar robustness. Wizards grind on Dlvl 1-3 as in eL1fe's engine;
  Rogues, Knights, Tourists and Priests keep the Dlvl-1-only grind (`ROLE_GRIND_LEVELS`).
  (I found the cast bug independently; eL1fe's version is used.)
- **Identity router** as in daglar-dragomirov/nethacker@e29eb82 (the verified-tier leader): Healers (pf_hg, pf_hh)
  and Samurai (pf_v35) play specialist engines; everyone else plays nhbot with DIVE_XL 8
  (nhbot is then identical to e29eb82's pf_base apart from the changes listed here).
- `roles.py`: per-identity overrides of engine settings (only for nhbot identities).
- `MEDUSA_HOP` (off pending A/B): on Medusa's level with no dry square on our islet, step into a one-square moat
  channel toward land that has one (trap.c drown(): the hero crawls out at once to a random free land square).
- `MINES_TOOL_TRIP` (on; +0.018 +- 0.007 per game over 272 paired held-out games): a tool-less planned dive takes the Mines route for any race (it was for
  dwarves and gnomes only), so humans, elves and orcs go and take a dwarf's pick-axe.
- DT6A's two-page `#enhance` fix (DT6A/nethacker@c9a42ac): tty menus restart item letters on each page; the parser's
  assert then fired on every fight start.
- CleverShovel's ring/amulet/scroll module (CleverShovel/nethacker@9dc0822 V1, @29ab0a7 V2), Wizards only, behind
  `RING_MODULE` (A/B pending): wears identified useful rings (slow digestion, free action, poison resistance...),
  combat-only rings in fights, sheds rings when Hungry, reads scrolls at safe moments to identify rings/amulets.
- Archeologists dig-dive from XL 5 instead of 3 (`ARC_DIG_DIVE_XL`): +0.024 +- 0.013 over 236 paired held-out games.
- Small fixes found by log analysis: the panic-loop breaker now also forbids a square a monster keeps blocking
  (`PANIC_TILE_FIX`; one grind sat 38k turns), divers keep fighting with the wielded pick-axe/mattock unless the best
  weapon is clearly better (`DIG_TOOL_MELEE`), a timed-out pet ditch is retried (`DITCH_RETRY`), a trapping gas spore is
  only hit when its blast can't kill (`SPORE_TRAP_FIX`).
- Known cold/fire wands are zapped only with a free run of squares behind the target (`RAY_BOUNCE_FIX`): seven logged
  deaths came from the bot's own bounced ray.
- `AT_THREAT_AVOID` (off pending A/B): while an elf, soldier or other Elbereth-ignoring meleer comes for a pick-axe
  digger above Medusa's level, no pit is started (every attack stops the dig; in the pit the fight is at -3 to-hit): a
  known wand of digging holes the floor at once, else the @ is fought on level ground first.
- **v3:** human Priests play nhbot instead of pf_pa (+0.053 +- 0.022 per game over 113 paired held-out games); bug fixes
  from a log study of the games that end above Dlvl 10 (`research` notes in the workspace): a prayer interrupted by a
  strategy switch is still recorded (`PRAYER_RECORD_FIX`), the prayer model's alignment record follows pray.c (+1 only
  for prayers without major trouble, `RECORD_MODEL_FIX`), fight2 charges a ray's bounce through us its real cost
  (`SELF_ZAP_FIX`), no pickup that leaves us Stressed and a lycanthrope's corpse weighs what its human form does
  (`HEAVY_LIFT_GUARD`); a garbled Elbereth is rewritten after a mid-dig faint (`ELBERETH_REWRITE_FIX`).
- Tried and left off (flags kept for reference): `AT_THREAT_AVOID` (no pit while an elf/soldier comes: -0.004 +- 0.003
  over 235 deterministic pairs), `MEDUSA_HOLE_CYCLE` (skip Medusa's level through our own hole from above: the skip works
  1 time in 4-6, but the extra landings cost more, -0.015 +- 0.005 per Medusa game), Wizards on the Dlvl-1 grind
  (-0.058 +- 0.026 over 101 pairs).
- **v4:** fixes from log studies of the deep game and of Wizards (`research` notes in the workspace). Deep game: lawful
  minions (Aleax, couatl, ...) ignore Elbereth (`LMINION_ELBERETH`), a safe prayer before a heal at critical HP deep in the
  dive (`DEEP_PRAY_FIRST`), no castle-only strategies on a deep Medusa level, Medusa-2 recognised by its titan's messages,
  a stranded Medusa-3 '<' rerolls, minotaur guard fixes (`MINO_*`): +0.0021 +- 0.0012 over 512 deterministic held-out
  pairs vs v3. Wizards: force bolt beats the melee bonus against Elbereth-ignorers and is cast from an Elbereth square at
  what the engraving doesn't scare (`FB_FOCUS`; 52 of 412 Wizard games died meleeing with power left), no casting while
  stunned/confused, no ray-wand zaps in the grind while the bolt is castable; a starving pet gets the corpses, a pet
  turned hostile is fought, no Elbereth on altars. Knights stay on the Dlvl-1 grind (the deep grind: -0.020 +- 0.023 over
  160 pairs); a durable (engraved) Elbereth for holds measured +0.000 over 512 pairs (flag off).

- **v5:** merged daglar-dragomirov/nethacker@6c814836 (the generalist-board leader, mean 0.350) into this v4 tree, which
  was already a strict superset of its engine-code changes (v4's deep-game and Wizard fixes are additive new flags;
  daglar made no edits to those nhbot files). Adopted from daglar: the populated per-identity `OVERRIDES` in `roles.py`
  (arc/cav/mon/pri/wiz play aggressive — `RING_MODULE` and `MEDUSA_HOP` on, the four safety flags off, `DIVE_XL` 8;
  bar/kni/ran/rog/tou/val play safe — the opposite, `ran` `DIVE_XL` 7), the `^X` attributes-screen identity probe
  (`roles.attributes_identity`, so the per-role config applies even when the welcome line is missed), and the Tourist
  engine `pf_dtad7a` (DT6A/nethacker@ad7a864) routed for `tou`. The `RING_MODULE`/`MEDUSA_HOP` module code is
  byte-identical to daglar's, so this reproduces the leader's behaviour exactly, with v4's extra fixes on top.

## Experimental zV10cCollision
Experimental complete zV10cCollision on exact whole open zarutskiysy v10c@f3a2a428f4180dd02520b858fbd6feba035a792b. Exact whole Private Generalist leader v10c retains all73 routes,60main/13specialists. Repair joint recursive probability and independent branch range as in completed zV10cRay, then apply source-defined collision geometry. Source-defined regular-ray known-terrain collision kernel: stone/mines-wall/other-wall reversal probabilities1/10,1/20,1/75; single-side reversal branch retained; diagonal eligibility requires room or ray-open lookahead. Closed doors absorb, bars and known wet terrain transmit. Unknown floor classification remains parent fallback. Normal obstacle cursor retained. Initial13-budget and all priorities, inventory admission and reservations unchanged; no horizon candidate imported. Terrain memory can be stale. Unknown floors/traps use parent fallback. Misses/reflection, conditional hit attenuation, type-specific wet-floor effects, drawbridges and air-level disappearance remain approximate; this is not an exact simulator. Changed hostile/self/friend weights may help or hurt. Fixtures prove contracts, not score improvement or whole-game CPU cost. 146actual welcome/missing route fixtures,357new collision/path/action and72additional actual barrier actions contracts and71independent branch/priority contracts on actual v10c functions. Whole parent selected by direct human authorization from the complete aggregate Private Generalist table; changes fixed from NLE1.3.0 source, no peridentityPrivate choices, private patch tuning or closedseed/trace access. Provenance and MIT license retained.73newsmoke100420 plus1095nativePublic; incremental registration after smoke/sanity/exact evaluated-local-Git bytes. No confirmed generalist gain claim or automatic fresh matrix. The two frozen comparisons and both horizon variants stay unchanged.

## Experimental zV10cImmunity
Experimental complete zV10cImmunity on github.com/daglar-dragomirov/nethacker@03753a61ac43552e2f238a65b2e628c17fc158cb. Whole exact leader and all73 routes retained. In actual ray planner suppress positive hostile HP damage credit only for identified fire/cold wands against visible innate mresists. Ray path, range and self/pet/peaceful penalties remain exact to parent. Hidden equipment resistance is not inferred. Lightning, death, magic missile and ambiguous/missing metadata retain parent treatment. Transfer parent includes its coherent probability/terrain kernel; no reflection, healing or horizon patches imported. Less HP-damage credit can forgo incidental terrain effects or ancillary tactical utility. Lightning is deliberately unchanged because blindness/inventory damage matter. Innate absence does not establish vulnerability: hidden extrinsic resistance remains unknown. Model and selector fixtures prove behavior, not arena imports, survival or score gain. Whole73 smoke/native remain required. 800 new actual full-path/priority fixtures with the real parent danger classifier,512 source-bitmask fixtures and160 prior controlled priority fixtures,146 welcome/missing routes. Source and completed DEV justify the change; no active partial outcomes, Private route/parameter selection or closed seeds/traces. Provenance and license retained.73 new smoke seed100426, then1095 nativePublic with immediate per-identity registration after smoke/sanity/exact evaluated-local-Git bytes. No confirmed generalist improvement or automatic fresh matrix. Two existing fresh comparisons remain immutable.
